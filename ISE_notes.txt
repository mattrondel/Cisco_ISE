Create Device Administration Policy Sets
To create a device administration policy set:

Before you begin
Ensure that the Device Administration in the Work Centers > Device Administration > Overview > Deployment window is enabled for TACACS+ operations.

Ensure that any User Identity Groups, (for example, System_Admin, Helpdesk) required for the policy are created. ( Work Centers > Device Administration > User Identity Groups page). Ensure that the member users (for example, ABC, XYZ) are allocated to their corresponding groups. ( Work Centers > Device Administration > Identities > Users window).

Ensure to configure TACACS settings on devices that need to be administered. ( Work Centers > Device Administration > Network Resources > Network Devices > Add > TACACS Authentication Settings check box is enabled and the shared secret for TACACS and devices are identical to facilitate the devices to query Cisco ISE.)

Ensure that the Network Device Group, based on the Device Type and Location, is created. ( Work Centers > Device Administration > Network Device Groups window)
